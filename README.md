# Elucidat PHP/JS code test

This test is intended for developers looking to work with Elucidat.

It covers PHP and Javascript.

Install by uploading to a web server (or Mamp/Wamp) and pointing the home directory to public_html/

Then open in a browser - and you'll find the test instructions.

You'll be here because you've been invited to take the test - but if you've found your own way here - have a go - we'd love to see what you do (and we are always looking for great developers).

Depending on your platform, there may be some problems running this code out of the box. If that stops you - this probably isn't going to work out...
